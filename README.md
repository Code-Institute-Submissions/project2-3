# Dragon Age Data Visualization

## Data

All quest data (432 entries with 5 categories each) used to create the graphs were typed up by me for this specific project the weekend before project week began. 
 
## Overview
 
### What is this website for?
 
This is a fan site for those who have played Dragon Age: Inquisition who want in depth details about all the quests available throughout the game.
 
### What does it do?
 
This site has 1 page with 4 graphs using the quests data: 1 showing starting locations, 1 showing ending locations, 1 showing difficulty levels based on starting locations, and 1 showing the different categories available.
 
### How does it work
 
This site uses simple HTML and CSS. The site is also styled with **Bootstrap**. The graphs have been created using **Javascript** and DC/D3 data visualization. Heroku was used to deploy this web page. All the data is stored in json files in my data folder. The site can be viewed [HERE](https://dragonagequests.herokuapp.com)
